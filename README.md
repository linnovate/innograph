Innograph was created to define a set of shared schemas for projects and platforms that used graphQL for their object module.
Many platforms and projects could share the same object module and would be happy to contribute or collaberate around their schemas.

## Origin Story

Like any superhero technology one much understand the origin story to understand the project...
The project was created around the need to create an interoptability layer for several projects working on innovation management so they can share schemas, components and microservices.
